# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Quick Icon Creation

You can create simple icons using:
1. Online tools like [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/)
2. Image editors (GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)
3. Icon design tools

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have icons yet, the extension will still work but may show a default browser icon. You can add icons later and reload the extension.

## Icon Design Tips

- Use a simple, recognizable design
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Test at all sizes (16px, 48px, 128px)
- Consider using a "block" or "shield" theme to match the extension's purpose
